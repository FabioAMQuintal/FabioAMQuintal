### What is up, guys?
WelcomeðŸ‘‹ 
<br> My name is Fabio and I'm from SÃ£o Paulo.

 My history as a Softwear Engineer might be considered a bit confusing!
### But calm down, I'll explain everything :D
 I'm graduated in Information Technology (2013) but it was at the Mechatronics college(2020) that the passion for programming really happened.
 <br>At FATEC-SP, we developed and played with Arduido, building projects... And programming that was pretty cool!
 Well, the ~pandemic~ arrived and I went back to studying new technologies, and so many new things that were built there!
 I'm developing my portfolio, which I try to create all the solutions(or almost everything).
